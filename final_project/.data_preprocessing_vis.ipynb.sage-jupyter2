The data for cholesterol levels was measured in millimoles per deciliters. Some other data to consider is that there was outliers in this graph. An example of this was some participants had a cholesterol level of 0. I am not certain that  this measurement was an error so I decided to not include that data point in the range of this graph. For people with and without heart failure, both of the graphs peaked at around the same level with people who had heart disease at a cholesterol level of 200\\-219 mm/dL., and those without peaking at 220\\-239 mm/dL..\n\nThe graph of the resting blood pressure of people with and without heart disease was also very similar. Between each range, for both people with and without heart disease, the count of the participants that had a certain level at which their resting blood pressure increased and decreased between ranges. Every five, the count would increase, and then the next five, it would decrease.\n\nBased on these two graphs, I would conclude that Cholesterol Level and Resting Blood Pressure do not play a great factor in predicting whether a person has heart failure, as the graphs of people with and without heart failure for both categories are too similar.\n\n","pos":46,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b2d919","input":"For Max Heart Rate, it seems like there may be a correlation between higher heart rate in individuals with heart disease and individuals with no heart disease. However, looking at the female group especially, it appears that the difference may be insignificant due to the large overlap at the peaks of the graphs.\n\n","pos":55,"type":"cell"}

The last 25% of the data seems to be slightly different, but not too much to make a conclusion.`\n\n`This boxplot shows the restingBP for two groups, one with heart disease and one without.

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cd0e0b","input":"The heartrate boxplot indicates that heartrate is overall slower in people with heart disease, while people without heart disease have higher heart rates. For example, the minimum and maximum for people without heart disease had a significantly higher heart rate in comparison to those with heart disease. This may show that Heart Disease is often associated with lower heart rate, because it cannot function as well.\n\nThis visualization shows the Maximum heart rate for two groups, one with heart disease, and one without. In the heart disease boxplot, 50% of the data is between 112 and 144.5, and the rest of the data is between 67 and 182\n\nIn the group without heart disease, the boxplot shows that 50% of the data is between 134 and 165, and the rest of the data is between 90 and 202\n\nThe group without heart disease seems to have a much higher heart rate compared to the group with heart disease. From this data, we can conclude that heart rate might be an important factor in determining if someone has heart disease.\n\n","pos":15,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"db1ede","input":"This correlation matrix is comparing all columns in the table to see how correlated they are in other. This meaning, that a strong correlation means that there is a significant trend found in relation to another, and then scaling down until you get to neglibible in which they barely affect each other to no correlation where they have no affect at all on each other. Overall for most of the values there was either practically no correlation, a neglegible correlation, or a weak correlation. The highest instances would be described as a moderate correlation\\(if you take the definition of a moderate correlation to be between 0.5 and 0.7\\).These instances came in the relationship between ST\\_Slope and old peak with a correlation of 0.502, and a moderate correlation between heart disease and ST\\_Slope of 0.599.  ST\\_Slope is measured during a heart test and is supposed to go up when one does exercise. Therefore, an abnormal slope would be either staying flat or trending downward which could be a sign of heart disease. There are then a number of high low correlations coming to either 0.4 up to 0.494. The overall trend was that the bulk of the columns were correlated to each other between the correlation number of the absolute value 0.09 to the absolute value 0.35. There was a wide spread of values being both positive, meaning when one increases, the other can increase, and negative, which means when one value increases the other decreases. There were also some factors with an especially low correlation towards everything, namely RestingECG which had a highest value resulting in a weak correlation of 0.213 but often below 0.1.\n\n","pos":32,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"dd961e","input":"Maximum Heart Rate could be a factor that could greatly influence whether someone has heart disease or not. The graph of people without heart failure is skewed to having a higher maximum heart rate than the graph of people with heart failure which is skewed to the lower end. Both graphs are placed on the same scale so that the counts of the graphs can be compared. While the counts of people who did Not have heart failure are lower than the counts of people who did HAVE heart failure, the graphs give a clear indication people who do not have heart failure have a higher maximum heart rate. \n\n","pos":48,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ec65ce","input":"`Analysis: This is a scatter matrix which shows the scatter plots comparing all the continuous inputs in the data frame. I think this matrix shows that although heart disease is complicated and nothing is exactly one to one, there are general trends with certain traits that increase risks. For example, in the Age and MaxHR scatter plot, we see that people with heart disease generally trend towards being older and having a lower MaxHR. We can also see that people with a high Oldpeak tend to have heart disease. Some variables also have limited relationships with others. For example, we can see that broadly speaking, the higher the age the higher the resting RestingBP`\n\n","pos":34,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ed60dc","input":"Again, this first graph illustrates the Sex of participants with and without heart failure. Like the histogram of just the distribution of the sex without relation to heart failure, there are more males than females in the study. However, what the previous histogram didn't reveal was that in this data set, more males had heart disease than did not which compared to females had more females without heart disease than who did.\n\nThe final histogram reveals that a normal Old Peak should be 0. 253 participants without heart failure had an Old Peak of 0\\- 0.1 while 129 participants with heart failure had the same Old Peak. This data reveals that while Old Peak should be considered when determining heart failure, it is also due to other factors.
