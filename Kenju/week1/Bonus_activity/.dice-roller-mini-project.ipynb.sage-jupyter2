For while loops, they have the potential to run infinetly. While we may want this, it can also freeze our program. This means we need to set an acheivable end condition, or state where the loop will end.","pos":28,"state":"done","type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8b29bc","input":"This input is always read as text, or as a string. If we want to use user input in an equation, we would need to convert the string to an integer, or an int. For the default example 13 was entered, then 12.","pos":7,"state":"done","type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9c3977","input":"You should notice the range function as a part of the for loop, this is because python only has for loops that iterate over a list. For now, you don't have to worry about what the means, but the important take away is that the range function allows you to loop from 0 to the number in the parentheses, setting \"i\" to the current value. This value changes every loop through. We can see this below.","pos":23,"state":"done","type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a55142","input":"While the code still runs 5 times, the output has changed. It now includes 5!
